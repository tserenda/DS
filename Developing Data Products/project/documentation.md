This application uses the ISLR package to build a predictive model concerning the wage data. The wage data was collected on 3000 men working in the mid-Atlantic region. A simple linear regression model was used to predict the wage variable in relation to age, job class, marital status and education level. In the Inputs pane, you may wish to change the default parameters for your needs. Unfortunately, the model doesn't take into an account of your sexual orientation.

The application plots wage against age in terms of the job class to give the user a rough idea of the data. The coefficients of the simple linear regression were provided. At the bottom, you will find the predicted wage in the thousands of dollars,
